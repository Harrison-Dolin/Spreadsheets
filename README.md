A spreasheet program that allows for the editing and creation of a data table. Has an interactive window that allows for traversal of the table, along with an input bar for cell editing. Tables can be saved to .txt files. Tables can also be loaded from .txt files and those files can be overrwiten with edits. Can be opened in a view only or mutable state. Uses the swing library to handle visuals as well as keyboard and mouse listeners. 

The structure of the program is based on a model, view, controller design. Keeping the code loosely coupled allows for the easy import or substitution of additional views/controllers. Also, we used the builder pattern for easy constructability of the model.
